README: Pet Image

The application will look for a pet.png file in the resources folder.

If you want to use your own pet image:
1. Find a cute pet image (dog, cat, hamster, etc.)
2. Save it as "pet.png" in the src/main/resources folder
3. Make sure the image is square (e.g., 50x50 or 100x100 pixels)

If no image is found, the application will draw a default cute orange cat face.

Recommended image size: 50x50 to 100x100 pixels
Format: PNG with transparent background (optional)
